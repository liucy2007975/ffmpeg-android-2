FFMPEG for Android
------------------

This version is made in top of the bambuser original version.
All credits about toolchain / ffmpeg android are to http://bambuser.com/
Check the original source code at: http://bambuser.com/opensource

This version include a specific Python wrapper to decode audio / video,
implemented to be as portable as possible. The goal is to use it for a
core provider in the Kivy project, on android platform.

STATUS: working, but in heavy stabilization

Toolchain setup
---------------

Download the Android NDK Revision 5b from
http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html

Extract it into a folder (e.g. your home directory, the example is
for the mac os x version):

tar -jxvf android-ndk-r5b-darwin-x86.tar.bz2
mv android-ndk-r5b android-ndk


Extracting the source
---------------------

The original upstream source (and the patches, if any) can be extracted
by running ./extract.sh.

Building
--------

To build, first set the environment variable NDK to point to the
directory where the NDK is installed:

export NDK=~/android-ndk

Then just call ./build.sh.

To clean up the newly built files (removed unused files, remove libraries
with version numbers in the name), call ./clean-build.sh.

Building Python extension
-------------------------

cd python
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

And for testing:

python ffmpeg/__init__.py <yourvideofile.mkv>
